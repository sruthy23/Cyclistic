# Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company operating in Chicago with more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The company's finance analysts have concluded that annual members(customers who purchase an annual subscription) are much more profitable than casual riders(cutomers who purchase a single-ride or full-day pass). The purpose of this analysis is to identify key differences in the behavior between the two categories of users, that will enable the marketing team to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

## Insights
- majority of the rides were taken by members
- the average ride time for members was longer than that of casual riders. 
- the majority of the rides were taken during weekdays, particularly during the morning and evening rush hours.
