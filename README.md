# Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company operating in the state of Chicago with more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The company's finance analysts have concluded that the annual members(customers who purchase an annual subscription) are much more profitable than the casual riders(customers who purchase a single-ride or full-day pass). The purpose of this analysis is to identify key differences in the behavior between the two categories of users which will enable the marketing team to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

## Insights
- majority of the rides were taken by members (56%)
- the average ride time for casual riders(26m) was about twice that of annual members(13m) 
- casual riders are more active (higher number of rides) on the weekends as compared to the weekdays, whereas the converse is true for members.
- ride demand was seen to increase towards the evening with demand peaking between 4 pm and 5 pm for both members and casual riders. Additionally, a significant increase in rides was observed in the busy hours of morning(peaking at 8 am) for annual members.

## Recommendations
- Improve the user experience for casual riders: The analysis shows that casual riders have significantly higher usage during  weekends compared to weekdays. Cyclistic could improve the user experience for casual riders by providing more flexible membership plans and pricing that cater to their usage patterns.

- Offer incentives for longer rides: The analysis shows that casual riders tend to take longer rides than members. Cyclistic could offer incentives, such as discounts or rewards, to casual riders who take longer rides to encourage them to use the bikes more frequently.

- Increase availability of bikes in high-demand areas: The analysis shows that certain areas have higher demand for bikes than others. Cyclistic could improve customer satisfaction by increasing the availability of bikes in these areas during peak usage times.

- Expand marketing efforts to target non-members: The analysis suggests that there is a significant potential market of non-members who could be attracted to using the bike-sharing service. Cyclistic could expand their marketing efforts to target this group and attract them to try out the service.
