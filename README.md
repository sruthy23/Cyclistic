# Cyclistic
Cyclistic, a bike sharing company wants to identify key differences in the behavior between their two categories of users, those with a subscription(annual members) and those without one(casual riders).

## Insights
- majority of the rides were taken by members
- the average ride time for members was longer than that of casual riders. 
- the majority of the rides were taken during weekdays, particularly during the morning and evening rush hours.

## Recommendations
- Offer more incentives for casual riders to become members 
- increase the number of bikes available during the peak hours
- promote the bikes for commuting purposes
