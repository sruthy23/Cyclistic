# Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company operating in the state of Chicago with more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The company's finance analysts have concluded that the annual members(customers who purchase an annual subscription) are much more profitable than the casual riders(customers who purchase a single-ride or full-day pass). The purpose of this analysis is to identify key differences in the behavior between the two categories of users which will enable the marketing team to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

## Insights
- majority of the rides were taken by members (56%)
- the average ride time for casual riders(26m) was about twice that of annual members(13m) 
- casual riders are more active (higher number of rides) on the weekends as compared to the weekdays, whereas the converse is true for members.
- ride demand was seen to be the highest around 5 pm for both members and casual riders.
